Filename: magneto-interfaces-py.patch
Applies to: Magneto, Rigo, Entropy v1.0rc97

Allows Rigo to run as the System's Package manager getting rid of Sulfur finally! Rigo currently doesn't elevate privs needed to install/update pkgs, so we also call gksudo from magneto here. If you prefer gksu or kdesu/kdesudo then just alter the patch to contain your prefered method. Rigo *hopefully* will implement a working feature for elevating to root user for entropy manipulation without depending on these outside methods. After all this release still intends to use Sulfur for the Package Manager. 
 
This also gets rid of the annoying libnotify popup messages at the initial start of magneto:  {Sabayon Update Service loaded, Entropy DBUS service loaded your Sabayon will notify you once updates are available)
